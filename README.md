### 🌱 Currently Learning

I’m leveling up my skills with advanced concepts and production-focused learning:

⚙️ Deep diving into Kubernetes internals and building custom Helm charts

🔁 Automating CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions

☁️ Strengthening AWS fundamentals with IAM, networking, and cost-saving strategies

🧩 Exploring System Design from a DevOps engineer’s perspective

---

### 🚀 Highlighted Projects

- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins + Docker + Terraform**  
  End-to-end automation for a Node.js app. Jenkins handles CI, Docker for containerization, and Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure.

- ☸️ **EKS Deployment using Terraform + Helm + Ingress**  
  Deploys a containerized Node.js app to AWS EKS using Helm charts, Ingress Controller, and an external ALB.

- 🔐 **Secure Web App Deployment on AWS using Terraform**  
  Automated deployment of a highly available web app. HTML hosted in a private S3 bucket, served via NGINX on EC2 (in an ASG) behind an ALB. Public/private subnets ensure isolation and security.

### 🧠 Other Notable Projects

- 🔧 Ansible Setup with Terraform & Nginx Web Server  
- 📊 AWS Monitoring Stack with Prometheus + Grafana  
- 💾 EC2 Auto Backup using Cron + Shell Script
