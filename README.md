### 🚀 Highlighted Projects

- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins + Docker + Terraform**  
  End-to-end automation for a Node.js app. Jenkins handles CI, Docker for containerization, and Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure.

- ☸️ **EKS Deployment using Terraform + Helm + Ingress**  
  Deploys a containerized Node.js app to AWS EKS using Helm charts, Ingress Controller, and an external ALB.

- 🔐 **Secure Web App Deployment on AWS using Terraform**  
  Automated deployment of a highly available web app. HTML hosted in a private S3 bucket, served via NGINX on EC2 (in an ASG) behind an ALB. Public/private subnets ensure isolation and security.
